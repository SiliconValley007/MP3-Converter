A simple GUI program written in python which can be used to convert any mp4 file to mp3. You can also convert any mp4 or AVI file to a gif, but that takes that a lot of time to convert, so would not recommend that.

Run the following command in your command line to install the necessary packages:
> pip install moviepy, imageio
